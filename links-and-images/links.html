    <!-- If you want to creat a link, it is <a>, refering to anchor. -->
    <h1>Adding "a" allows webpage to access a link <a>images</a></h1>
    <!-- but this does not do anything. Yet. Only attribute adds meaning to
    the link(element) and hence the content that we want to see-->
    <h3> The "href" allows the user to go
      <a href='images.html'>somewhere</a> </h3>
      <!-- The 'a' goes first, then the attribute, and then the equal sign,
      after, the value of the attribute with quotation marks -->

    <!-- There are three types of URLs (Uniform resource locators)
    that which determines the value of the href: absolute, relative, and
    root-relative links-->

    <h2> Absolute links </h2>
    <p> {Scheme} - [Domain] - Path</p>
    <p> {HTTPS://} - [www.gamersky.com] - /en-us/docs/web </p>

    <li>Absolute links, like to
    <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'>Mozilla
    Developer Network</a>, which is a very good resource for web
    developers.</li>
    <!-- Absolute links are usually good for directing people to a
    different webpage -->

    <h2> Relative links </h2>
    <p> It is inside your website files, so all you need is to provide
      the <a href='misc/extras.html'>path</a></p>
    <!-- It is within the website file pages. All file pathes are separated by
    '/'. If there are many pathes, it goes like the CMD way -->

    <h2> Root relative website </h2>
    <p> if that's the case, the link will be <a href='/'>Home Page</a> </p>
    <!-- <a href='/'>Home Page</a> tend to work only on web served websites -->
    <!-- you don't have to start with '/' something, but "/" refers to the root
    of the website -->

    <h2> Link targest </h2>
    <li>Absolute links, like to
    <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML'
       target='_blank'>Mozilla Developer Network</a>, which is a very good
       resource for web developers.</li>
    <!-- If the key word "target" is inserted inside the attribute, it will
    oepn a new tab on the web page. "_blank" specify a tab or a window -->

    <h2> Naming conventions </h2>
    <p> Unless absolutely needed, don't add spaces to files, links, or anything
      coding related </p>
    <p> If in any sort, you need to use
      <a href='spaces%20are%20bad.html'>space</a>,
        this is required </p>
      <!-- "%20" makes the space possible. Hyphen is always better -->

    <h2> Images </h2>
    <p> This chapter does not everything about Images </p>
    <!-- <img/> is also an empty element. Keep in mind of:
    <figure> and <figcaption> -->
