    <h1>Images</h1>
    <p> Four usual formats of pictures: JPG, GIF, PNG, and SVG </p>
    <br/>
    <p>This page covers common image formats, but you may also be looking for <a
     href='links.html'>links</a> and <a href='misc/extras.html'>useful
     extras</a>.</p>

    <h2>JPGs</h2>

    <p>JPG images are good for photos.</p>

    <img src='images/mochi.jpg'/>
    <!-- jpg is good for color gradients, meaning it looks better with JPG -->

    <br/>
    <h2>GIFs</h2>

    <p>GIFs are good for animations.</p>

    <img src='images/mochi.gif'/>
    <!-- GIF is good for small animation, but it is ass in pictures -->

    <br/>
    <h2>PNGs</h2>

    <p>PNGs are good for diagrams and icons.</p>

    <img src='images/mochi.png'/>
    <!-- PNG is good for tiny little detailed photos, like icon, diagrams,
    logos, etc -->

    <br/>
    <h2>SVGs</h2>

    <p>SVGs are <strong>amazing</strong>. Use them wherever you can.</p>

    <img src='images/mochi.svg'/>
    <!-- SVG is really good at scaling. It does not lose pixel, but it does
    take up file size-->

    <br/>
    <h2> Scaling <h2>
    <!-- In retina, you need to double the image formats in retina displays. -->
    <!-- In JPGs section -->
    <img src='images/mochi.jpg' width='75' alt='A mochi ball in a bubble'/>
    <!-- The width attribute sets the dimension of the image. There's also a
    height attribute, and so scaling both of them will stretch the image.
    Setting only one of them will set proportionally. And don't include unit.
    It is by default px -->
    <!-- In GIFs section -->
    <img src='images/mochi.gif' width='75' alt='A dancing mochi ball'/>
    <!-- It is better to set the images' size in CSS. -->
    <!-- In PNGs section -->
    <img src='images/mochi.png' width='75' alt='A mochi ball'/>
    <!-- the "alt" makes people easier to search and easier to listen -->
    <img src='images/mochi.svg' alt='A mochi ball with BÃ©zier handles'/>
