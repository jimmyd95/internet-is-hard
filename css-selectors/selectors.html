      <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>

      <p class="synopsis">CSS selectors let you <em>select</em> individual HTML elements
        in an HTML documents. This is <strong>super</strong> useful.</p>

      <p>Classes are ridiculously importnat, since they allow you to select
        arbitrary boxes in your web pages.</p>

      <p>We'll also be talking about links in this example, so here's
        <a href='https://internetingishard.com'>Intereneting Is Hard</a> for us
        to style.</p>

      <a class="button" href='nowhere.html'>Button One</a>
      <!-- when using <a> instead of <div> it auto matically changed the
      element inside because <a> has default settings of it's own -->
      <a id="button-2" class="button call-to-action" href='nowhere.html'>Second Button</a>
      <!-- you can add other markups, and is seperated by a space -->
      <!-- if you have id selector, you are restricted with that one
       element -->
       <!-- ID attributes are also fragments, it can be considered as a part
        of URL -->

      <a href='#button-2'>Go to Button Two</a>
      <!-- same page as button-2 -->
      <a href='selectors.html#button-2'>Go to Button Two</a>
      <!-- no longer the same page -->

      <h2>Basic link Styles</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>link - link never visited</li>
        <li>visited - link visited</li>
        <li>hover - link been hovered</li>
        <li><a href='https://internetingishard.com'>active</a> - link been clicked</li>
      </ul>
      <div class='sidebar'>
        <p>If this page had a sidebar...</p>
        <!-- since we had the first-of-type on every <p>, this "sidebar" would
         be grey as well, which is not good -->
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
