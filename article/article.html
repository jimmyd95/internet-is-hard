          <p>By Troy McClure. Published <time datetime="2017-1-3 15:00-0800">
            January 3rd </time><!-- wraping a time into it allows the user to
              see the "time" as they please. the format is from largest period
              to smallest: year-month-date-time(24hr)-timezone --></p>
        </header>
        <aside class="advert"> <!-- this is essentially where you place ads -->
          <img src="some-advert-image.png">
        </aside> <!-- it's pretty good at highlighting definitions, stats, or
           quotations. If it looks different than the rest of the article, it
           might be <aside> -->
        <p>This is an example web page explaining HTML5 semantic markup.</p>

        <section>
        <!-- This way it can be easily identified and it is more descriptive -->
          <h2>The Document Outline</h2>
          <p>HTML5 includes several “sectioning content” elements that
             affect the document outline.</p>

          <figure> <!-- a figure: diagram, illustration, code snippet, etc -->
            <img src='semantic-elements.png' alt='Diagram showing <article>,
               <section>, and <nav> elements'/>
            <figcaption>New HTML5 semantic elements</figcaption>
            <!-- caption of <figure> -->
            <!-- <alt> serves as a text replacement of the image. <figcaption>
             is essentially the description of the image via text or image -->
            <!-- <figcaption> be seen easier than the invisible <alt> -->
          </figure>

          <h3>Headers</h3>
          <p>The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element is one such sectioning
             element.</p>

          <h3>Footers</h3>
          <p>And so is the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> element.</p>
        </section>


        <section>
        <!-- this can create a nice hook for CSS styles (certain color for
         certain section) -->
          <h2>Inline Semantic HTML</h2><!-- if you moved the heading outside the
             section, it goes nuts -->
          <!-- although h6 is the lowest among the headings, if with section,
           it can be independent from the rest of the pages -->
          <p>The <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> element is semantic, but it’s not
             sectioning content.</p>
        </section> <!-- only use section to a more descriptive wrapper, use the
           self-contained content for <article> -->
        <footer> <!-- footer is basically header that's at the bottom -->

      </footer>
      <!-- The whole "paragraph" is a tree graph that's listing all the
       hierachy of different Headers -->
    </div> <!-- auto margin and whatnot. flexbox requires <div>. sementics are
     for good navigations, if in doubt however, use <div> -->
  </body>

  <!-- note, some old (legacy) broswers might not recognize the semantic format.
    It would be a good idea to call display:block on the global CSS
    stylesheet. It will make new semantic elements behave like <div> -->
    <!--
    section, article, aside, footer, header, nav {
      display: block;
    }
    -->
